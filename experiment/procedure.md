# Procedure

## Experimental Procedure

### 1. Setup
1. Secure disc on low-friction rotational axis
2. Attach string with suspended mass
3. Set up sensors for ω, α, and time measurements

### 2. Conducting the Experiment
1. Hold mass at fixed height with taut string
2. Release mass without initial push
3. Record angular velocity at time intervals
4. Measure total rotations

### 3. Data Analysis
1. Calculate α from ω vs time data
2. Compute τ = r·T
3. Verify τ = I·α
4. Confirm work-energy theorem

### 4. Conclusion
1. Compare experimental vs theoretical values
2. Identify error sources
3. Evaluate support for theoretical principles

## Simulation Procedure

1. Set initial conditions (disc radius, masses, height)
2. Start simulation
3. Observe real-time data:
   - Angular velocity (ω)
   - Angular acceleration (α)
   - Time elapsed
   - Work and energy values
4. Track rotations
5. Compute torque
6. Verify τ = I·α
7. Compare work vs rotational KE
8. Analyze results using visualization tools

# Simulation Outputs
- Torque vs Angular Acceleration graph (linear)
- Work Done vs Energy Change (equal)
- Rotations vs Fall Height relationship
