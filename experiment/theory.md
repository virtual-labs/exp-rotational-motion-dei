# Theory

The experiment demonstrates the fundamental principles of rotational dynamics and the application of the work-energy theorem in rotational motion. It involves a rigid disc mounted on a horizontal axis with a light, inextensible string wound around its circumference. A mass is suspended from the free end of the string, and upon release, the falling mass causes the disc to rotate due to the torque generated by the tension in the string.

## 1. Newton's Second Law for Rotational Motion

In linear motion, Newton's second law states:
F = m·a

For rotational motion, the analogous relationship is:
τ = I·α

Where:
- τ = torque [Nm]
- I = moment of inertia [kg·m²]
- α = angular acceleration [rad/s²]

Torque is calculated as:
τ = r × F = r·F·sinθ

For tangential force application (θ=90°):
τ = r·F

## 2. Torque and Angular Acceleration in the Experimental System

### Torque from Tension
τ = r·T

### Angular Acceleration
α = τ/I = (r·T)/I

### Kinematic Constraint (No-Slip Condition)
a = r·α

### Combined Dynamics
1. Falling mass (linear):
   m·g - T = m·a

2. Disc (rotational):
   T = (I·a)/r²

3. Final acceleration:
   a = (m·g)/(m + I/r²)
   α = a/r

## 3. Work-Energy Theorem in Rotational Dynamics

### Linear Motion
W = ΔKE_linear = ½m(v_f² - v_i²)

### Rotational Motion
Work done by torque:
W = ∫τ dθ

For constant torque:
W = τ·Δθ

Rotational kinetic energy:
KE_rot = ½Iω²

Work-energy theorem for rotation:
W = ΔKE_rot = ½I(ω_f² - ω_i²)

## 4. Energy Considerations

### Work done by torque
W_τ = τ·Δθ = r·T·(h/r) = T·h

### Energy conservation
m·g·h = ½Iω_f² + ½m·v_f²

## 5. Theoretical Predictions

### I. Torque-Angular Acceleration Relationship
- Plot τ vs α should yield straight line with slope = I

### II. Work-Energy Verification
- Compare W = τ·Δθ with ΔKE_rot = ½Iω²

### III. Experimental Validation
- Measure a and α to verify τ = I·α
